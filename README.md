# Vietnamese Crimes Laws News Summarization  

This project focuses on summarizing Vietnamese crime and law-related news articles by finetuned deep learning models: ViT5, MBart and MT5.  

## 📌 Features  
- Pre-trained deep learning models for text summarization.  
- Custom dataset processing crawl from VNExpress, Bao Phap Luat Viet Name,  and training pipeline.  
- Support for both training from scratch and using pre-trained results.  

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### **Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TRungtu041203/Vietnamese-Crimes-Laws-News-Summarization.git
   cd Vietnamese-Crimes-Laws-News-Summarization
Usage
1️⃣ Train a New Model

Run train/mbart.ipynb and train/ViT5.ipynb

2️⃣ Use Pre-Trained Model (Skip Training)

If you don’t want to train the model, you can use the pre-trained results available here:
